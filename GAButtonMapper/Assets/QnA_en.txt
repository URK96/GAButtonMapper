Q1> I even set up mapping after granting permissions, but it doesn't work.

A1> The app is not properly granted permissions. Please reboot and retry after completing the mapping setup.



Q2> The mapping operation didn't work at some point, so it will work again after a while.

A2> If the machine runs out of memory (RAM), the mapping app is cleaned up and shut down. Enabling the Ignore Battery Optimization setting minimizes the number of occurrences of that phenomenon.



Q3> Even if set up and operate LG QuickPay, it will only be connected to the main screen of LG Pay.

A3> There is a problem with LG Pay app. Please delete all registered cards and re-register or reinstall the LG Pay app after deleting it.


Q4> Mapping behavior is not operated intermittent.

A4> This happens when logs are uploaded all at once due to a lot of activity inside the machine. This phenomenon is limited to log-based capture, so please press the button to avoid when the device has a lot of activity.



Q5> A long or double click is recognized as a single click.

A5> As with Q4, this happens when many actions are performed a lot of activity. Under Mapping Settings, adjust Long-Click or Click Interval settings to the instrument environment and press the button to avoid when the device has a lot of activity. 



Q6> Where can I check the recorded file?

A6> It is saved at 'Android - data - com.lgplus.gabtmap - files' directory. All recorded files will delete when the app is removed, so it is recommended that you move the saved files in advance after recording.
